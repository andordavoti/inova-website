              John has over 20 years experience as a consultant in PwC and Deloitte.
              In 2019 John Inspire made a life changing decision, he abandoned his materialistic lifestyle in Norway.
              He traveled to India and donated all his wealth to charity. In India he lived a frugal life,
              and learned the methods for coping with little resources from the local street vendors.
              After a year he had managed to save up enough money to book a flight to return to Norway.
              With a life changing experience and a new outlook on business, John Inspire decided to start
              Inova in order to help other businesses do better with less.

              Name knows everything about everything. She handles all logistics, economy, customer relations and
              a lot of other stuff to. She is able to do so much with so little, it is really fascinating.
              She is self-taught in all of these fields from just googling. It doesn't get more frugal than that.
