            John has over 20 years experience as a consultant in PwC and
            Deloitte. In 2019 John Inspire made a life changing decision, he
            abandoned his materialistic lifestyle in Norway. He traveled to
            India and donated all his wealth to charity. In India he lived a
            frugal life, and learned methods for coping with little resources
            from the local street vendors. After a year he had managed to save
            up enough money to book a flight to return to Norway. With a life
            changing experience and a new outlook on business, John Inspire
            decided to start Inova in order to help other businesses do better
            with less.

            Live knows everything about everything. She handles all logistics,
            economy, customer relations and a lot of other stuff to. She is able
            to do so much with so little, it is really fascinating. She is
            self-taught in all of these fields from just googling. It doesn't
            get more frugal than that. She is the spine of our company, and we
